# Todos app.
  Very simple front-end app that uses `localStorage` for saving text todos that contains the text to be input by the user and a is completed state.
  Todos cannot be updated but it state of completed; they can be removed. The data is visible in various tabs/devices in real time.
  Todos uses an ID for tracking them. It has a text filter.
  The design and CSS is very basic (generic) since it's not the goal of this project.
  Done with the Note app for future use.
